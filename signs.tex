A sign is any object on which is written, printed, painted, embossed, inscribed, or otherwise marked words, letters, numbers, and/or symbols.  House numbers, utility pole identification letters and/or numbers, mail boxes and newspaper boxes, graffiti and signs of a temporary nature such as political posters, and signs on vehicles will not be used.

A sign is identified in route instructions in upper case (all capital letters), numbers or symbols enclosed in qutation marks (``'').  When quoted, a sign will be exact with respect to spelling, punctuation, detail, and shape of symbols as close as graphically reasonable.

All or any prominent part of a sign may be quoted; however, no intervening words, letters, or numerals or symbols will be skipped, split, combined, or reordered.  Hyphens and dashes are considered integral parts of words, letters, and numerals.  A sign is read from left to right, top to bottom, or in the sequence presented on the sign.

A sign used as a reference may be on the left, right, or overhead, approximately parallel to your line of travel, approximately facing you, or at any angle in between.
