\section{Rally Route}

\subsection{Rally Route}
To follow the intended rally route, proceed by taking the following actions in the order listed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Execute an emergency instruction provided by a rally official.

\item Execute a supplemental instruction provided at a control.

\item Execute a note instruction.

\item Execute a numbered route instruction.

\item Follow the main road.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Rally Roads}
A rally road is a public through road.  Unless otherwise directed, a rally road may be paved or unpaved.  Roads marked ``PRIVATE'', ``KEEP OUT'', ``NO OUTLET'', ``DEAD END'', ``ROAD CLOSED'', ``NO THROUGH TRAFFIC'', etc. do not exist.  Roads that are visibly barricaded or impassable do not exist.  Cul-de-sacs and roads which visibly dead-end do not exist.  Roads having illegal entry or roads requiring an illegal turn do not exist.

\subsection{Intersections}
An intersection is any joining of rally roads from which the contestant could legally proceed in more than one direction without U-Turning.

A roundabout is a joining of rally roads where traffic travels counterclockwise around a central island.  Traffic enters the roundabout without deviation.  One in the roundabout, the main road continues around the roundabout by PROTECTION since all deviations from the circular route are protected by yield signs.  If placed ONTO a road by name or number or TOWARD a landmark, the main road is the road exiting the roundabout as so identified by a sign.  Exiting a roundabout on the same road where the roundabout was entered is a legal deviation and is not considered a u-turn.

\subsection{U-turns}
No uninstructed U-turn(s) will be necessary to follow the rally route.

\subsection{Course Markers}
The club initials ``CSCC'' identify all course markers.

\begin{itemize}

\item On-course markers are bright green.

\item Off-course markers are bright orange.

\item Course correction markers are on-course markers upon which a route instruction number is written; execute that numbered route instruction at that location and continue in numerical order from that point on.

\item Roads posted with an off-course marker upon which the initials ``DNE'' are written do not exist; do not consider such a road as a rally road or route possibility.

\end{itemize}
