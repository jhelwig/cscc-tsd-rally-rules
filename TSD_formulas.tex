\section{TIME-SPEED-DISTANCE FORMULAS}
\subsection{Odometer Correction Factor}
\indent Odometer correction factor = Your odometer Miles / Official miles
\indent Corrected Speed = CAST X Odometer correction factor

If your odometer miles are less than Official miles, you must drive slower. If your “odo” is greater than Official, you must drive faster to stay on time.

\subsection{TSD Timekeeping}
Use the following formula to calculate precisely how long it should
take to travel a specific distance at a specific average speed.
\indent Time = (60 X Distance) / Speed
\indent Example: CAST 30 next 2 miles
\indent Time = (60 X 2) / 30 = 4 minutes

\subsection{Gaining Time}
Use the following formula to calculate what your average speed
should be to complete a GAIN.
\indent Speed = 60 / ((Time at stated CAST – GAIN time) / Distance)
\indent Example: CAST 30, then GAIN 1 minute next 2 miles
\indent Speed = 60 / ((4 – 1) / 2) = 40 mph
